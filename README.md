# pokemonTask

// 1. Write REST API to create a layer on the pokemon API mention in #Requirements. It must have endpoints to fetch pokemon list, pokemon data based on id, and other filters like ability, pokemon type, etc.
// 2. Build a React application that fetches and displays Pokemon stats in a card. The application should include an input field where users can type the name of a Pokemon. The API should be called as soon as the user stops typing, and this functionality should be achieved using debounce.
// Requirements:
// 1. Use the Pokemon API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/POKEMON_NAME
// 2. Implement a debouncing mechanism to trigger the API call only when the user stops typing for a specified duration (say 500 milliseconds).
// 3. Display the Pokemon's name and stats in a card format.
// 4. Provide appropriate error handling for failed API calls.
